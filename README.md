# Coinbase Case Study

## Overview and Origin

**Name of company**
---
Coinbase

* When was the company incorporated?
2012

* Who are the founders of the company?
Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
In 2012, Brian Armstrong, and former engineer for Airbnb, and Fred Ersham, a former Goldman-Sachs Trader met on reddit and shared a bullish view on bitcoin. They then decided to partner up and bring their vision of a easily accessible and secure platform for sending and receiving bitcoin to reality. Since then they have broaden their scope to include over 250 cryptocurrencies

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
To Date Coinbase has received a total funding amount of $498.7m. As is the case with most start ups, they began by receiving series/venture capital funding and Post IPO Equity funding after going public on April 14, 2021.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Coinbase's primary mission is to increase economic freedom through the wide spread adoption of cryptocurrency. They aim to accomplish this by making transacting with cryptocurrency safe, approachable, and convenient.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Coinbase's target audience is primarily the millenial age group (between 25-45 years) ranging from "low-tech" to "high-tech" individuals around the globe. There are an estimate 1.8 Billion millenials globally. While this group is likely an overestimation of their target audience it does illustrate just how large this sector can be. While Coinbase does not boast the largest trading volume in comparison to its competitors, it makes up for this with its superior security and regulatory adherence, having earned the highest "Quality/Safety Score" among its competitors according to study by Cryptocompare. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
In 2020, the coinbase mobile app was completely reworked using Reactive Native which allowed for improved reliability, security, and overall performance. Coinbase also implements Web3 technology which allows for users to manage their content, data, or digital assets through their coinbase wallet. In 2014, Coinbase implemented AWS(Amazon Web Services) into their system due to the suite of services it provides. Coinbase also offers an application programming interface (API) which allows for developers to integrate crypto into their new or existing apps.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Coinbase is a part of the Cryptocurrency sector of the financial industry

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
One of the largest innovations in the crypto space was the introduction of Ethereum's smart contracts in 2015. Smart contracts in their simplest terms allows for an agreement between two entities in the form of if/then statements written into code on the blockchain. This created an entirely new use case for crypto beyond serving as just a replacement for fiat money.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Some of Coinbases primary competitors include Binance, Kraken, Kucoin, and Robinhood 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
One of the biggest impacts Coinbase has made on the crypto sector is what is known as the "Coinbase Effect." Similarly to how the S&P appoints certain securities to the major index funds like the S&P 500, Coinbase functions as similar gatekeepers, deciding which crypto to list on their platform which can often make or break the coin, showing just how much Coinbase can influence the crypto market.
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The primary metrics by which crypto exchance companies measure their success are: number of verified users on the platform, monthly transactions each users performs, and the trading volume.
While second in trading volume only to Binance, Coinbase has one of the higest verified user counts with over 56 million registered users with over 6.1 million users making at least one transaction a month. While data for registered users could not be found for Binance, Kucoin and Kraken have a user base of 6 and 18 million respectively, showcasing just how dominate Coinbase is in the crypto space. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would recommend Coinbase overhaul their charts and implement technical indicators much like tradingview offers. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Adding more detailed charts with proven technical indicators could boost retail investor confidence and allow them to make more informed investing decisions. Ultimately this will allow for more monthly transactions per user.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Implementing Python would allow Coinbase to code the chart and indicator from the ground up.
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Python is uniquely appropriate for this as it has a wide range of data analysis, visualization, and trading libraries at its disposal that are well suited for financial analysis.
